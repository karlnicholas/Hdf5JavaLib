# Hdf5JavaLib

Hdf5JavaLib is a pure Java library for reading HDF5 files, currently in beta. It supports reading datasets in the root group, such as compound datasets, scalars, vectors, and multi-dimensional data tested up to 4D, from files generated by the C++ HDF5 library. This library is ideal for developers experimenting with HDF5 file reading in Java without external dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karlnicholas/Hdf5JavaLib.git
   ```
2. **Build with Maven**:
   ```bash
   cd Hdf5JavaLib
   mvn install
   ```
3. **Requirements**:
   - Java 17+.
   - No external HDF5 libraries needed.

## Read Capabilities

The library reads datasets in the root group, including:
- Compound datasets (e.g., structured data with integers, strings).
- Scalar, vector, and multi-dimensional datasets (tested up to 4D).
- Various datatypes (fixed-point, floating-point, strings, etc.).

For detailed usage and examples, see the [Read Capabilities Documentation](docs/read.md).

## Limitations

- **Beta Status**: Limited to reading datasets in the root group.
- **No Subgroups**: Groups beyond the root group are not supported.
- **No Compression or Chunking**: Cannot read compressed or chunked datasets.
- **Partial Metadata**: Supports SNODs but not attributes or advanced structures.
