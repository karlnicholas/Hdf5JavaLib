# Hdf5JavaLib: HDF5 Support for Java

Hdf5JavaLib is a pure Java library for reading HDF5 files, released as version 0.2.1. It provides robust HDF5 support in Java, enabling developers to read datasets in the root group, including compound datasets, scalars, vectors, and multi-dimensional data, from files generated by the C++ HDF5 library. Ideal for scientific computing and data analysis without external dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Add the Dependency

Hdf5JavaLib is available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.hdf5javalib/hdf5javalib/0.1.1/jar). Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hdf5javalib</groupId>
    <artifactId>hdf5javalib</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Requirements
- Java 17 or higher.
- No external HDF5 libraries required.
